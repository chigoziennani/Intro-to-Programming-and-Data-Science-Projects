**EX00: Hello, World!**

**Goal**: Write your first Python program
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Basic Python syntax, printing to console

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll write your first Python program that prints the classic "Hello, World!" message. This will introduce you to Visual Studio Code, creating and saving Python files, and running Python programs from the terminal.

**EX01: Simple Battleship Setup**

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: User Input, Conditional Statements

**Description**:
This exercise is the first step towards building a Battleship game. You'll prompt Player 1 to input a secret number between 1 and 4, representing the location of a ship. Then, you'll prompt Player 2 to guess the secret number. Finally, you'll inform Player 2 whether their guess was a hit or miss, using colored boxes as visual feedback. You'll also handle cases where the input is out of range.

**EX02: One-Shot Battleship**

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: User Input, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
Building upon the previous exercise, you'll create a program that allows the player one shot at guessing the secret boat location on a 4x4 grid. The player will input a row and column for their guess, and the program will provide feedback on whether the guess was a hit, a miss, or close (correct row or column). The program will also handle out-of-range inputs for rows and columns.

**EX03: Functional Battleship**

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Functions, User Input, Conditional Statements, Loops  

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will use the concept of functions to organize much of the functionality developed in EX02. Moreover, rather than only getting one attempt at guessing the secret boat location, you will get five attempts. The program will provide feedback on each guess and track the number of turns taken.

**EX04: Implementing Past Abstractions**

**Goal**: Reproducing Commonly Used Algorithms and Abstractions
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: List Operations, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will implement algorithms to reproduce tried-and-true abstractions and functionalities from the past. You will gain familiarity with the names and behaviors of commonly useful functions, such as finding the maximum element in a list, checking equality between lists, and extending a list. The exercise aims to develop your computational thinking skills and understanding of fundamental algorithms and abstractions.

**EX05: Dictionary Utils**

**Goal**: Practicing Dictionary Functions
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Dictionaries, Functions, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will get practice with dictionary functions. You will implement functions such as inverting a dictionary, counting the frequencies of elements in a list, finding the most popular color in a dictionary of names and favorite colors, alphabetizing a list of words into a dictionary, and updating an attendance dictionary.

**EX06: Dictionary Unit Tests**

**Goal**: Writing Unit Tests for Dictionary Functions
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Unit Testing, Test Cases, Dictionaries, Functions

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will return to the dictionary functions you built in the previous exercise. You will practice writing unit tests for each of these functions, checking if your solutions work under a variety of circumstances. The unit tests will make testing your functions easier and will reassure you of their correctness.

**EX07: Sorting Algorithms and Runtime Analysis**

**Goal**: Implementing Sorting Algorithms and Analyzing Performance
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Big-O Notation, Runtime Analysis, Memory Usage Analysis

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will modify an existing codebase to implement two sorting algorithms: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort. You will also generate worst-case input data for these algorithms and analyze their runtime and memory usage using visualizations. The exercise aims to help you understand algorithm implementation, Big-O notation, and performance analysis.

**EX09: River Ecosystem Simulation**

**Goal**: Object-Oriented Programming and Simulation
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Simulation

**Part I Description**:
In this part, you will create classes to simulate a river ecosystem with bears and fish. You will define classes for `Bear`, `Fish`, and `River`, and implement their attributes and methods. Additionally, you will simulate "one day" and "one week" in the river ecosystem by updating the state of bears and fish.

**Part II Description**:
Building upon Part I, you will enhance the river ecosystem simulation by adding features like removing animals based on age, modeling bear hunger, and simulating reproduction for bears and fish. You will modify existing methods and implement new ones to incorporate these additional behaviors.

**EX10: Linked List Algorithms**

**Goal**: Implement algorithms to process a singly-linked list data structure
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Linked Lists, Recursion, Conditional Statements, Indexing, Scaling

**Description**:
In this exercise, you will implement several functions to process a singly-linked list data structure. You will write recursive functions to perform operations such as retrieving the value at a given index, finding the maximum value, creating a linked list from a list of integers, and scaling the values in a linked list by a given factor. These functions will help you understand and work with linked lists, recursion, and various linked list operations.
