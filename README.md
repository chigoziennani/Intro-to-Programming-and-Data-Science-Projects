# Python-Programming-Exercises

This repository contains a series of Python programming exercises aimed at beginners to help them grasp fundamental concepts. Each exercise focuses on a specific topic and includes a description of the goal and the techniques involved. Below is a breakdown of the exercises:

## EX00: Hello, World!

**Goal**: Write your first Python program  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Basic Python syntax, printing to console

**Description**:
This exercise introduces you to Python programming by writing a simple program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. You'll learn how to use Visual Studio Code, create and save Python files, and execute Python programs from the terminal.

## EX01: Simple Battleship Setup

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: User Input, Conditional Statements

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll create the setup for a basic Battleship game. Player 1 will input a secret number representing the location of a ship, and Player 2 will guess the number. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess was correct, using colored boxes for visual feedback. It will also handle out-of-range inputs.

## EX02: One-Shot Battleship

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: User Input, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
Building upon the previous exercise, you'll create a program that allows Player 2 one shot at guessing the secret boat location on a 4x4 grid. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess was a hit, a miss, or close to the correct row or column. It will also handle out-of-range inputs.

## EX03: Functional Battleship

**Goal**: Implementing a Simple Battleship Game  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Functions, User Input, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll use functions to organize the functionality developed in EX02. You'll also extend the functionality to give the player five attempts at guessing the secret boat location. The program will provide feedback on each guess and track the number of turns taken.

## EX04: Implementing Past Abstractions

**Goal**: Reproducing Commonly Used Algorithms and Abstractions  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: List Operations, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
This exercise focuses on implementing algorithms to reproduce commonly used abstractions and functionalities from the past. You'll work with functions such as finding the maximum element in a list, checking equality between lists, and extending a list. The exercise aims to develop your computational thinking skills and understanding of fundamental algorithms and abstractions.

## EX05: Dictionary Utils

**Goal**: Practicing Dictionary Functions  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Dictionaries, Functions, Conditional Statements, Loops

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll gain practice with dictionary functions. You'll implement functions such as inverting a dictionary, counting the frequencies of elements in a list, and finding the most popular color in a dictionary of names and favorite colors. This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of dictionaries and related functions.

## EX06: Dictionary Unit Tests

**Goal**: Writing Unit Tests for Dictionary Functions  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Unit Testing, Test Cases, Dictionaries, Functions

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll write unit tests for the dictionary functions developed in the previous exercise. Writing unit tests will help you ensure that your functions work correctly under various circumstances. The tests will validate the correctness of your solutions and provide reassurance of their reliability.

## EX07: Sorting Algorithms and Runtime Analysis

**Goal**: Implementing Sorting Algorithms and Analyzing Performance  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Big-O Notation, Runtime Analysis

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll implement two sorting algorithms: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort. You'll analyze their runtime and memory usage using visualizations and understand their performance characteristics. This exercise will deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms and performance analysis.

## EX09: River Ecosystem Simulation

**Goal**: Object-Oriented Programming and Simulation  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Simulation

**Part I Description**:
This part involves creating classes to simulate a river ecosystem with bears and fish. You'll define classes for `Bear`, `Fish`, and `River`, and implement their attributes and methods. Additionally, you'll simulate "one day" and "one week" in the river ecosystem by updating the state of bears and fish.

**Part II Description**:
Building upon Part I, you'll enhance the river ecosystem simulation by adding features like removing animals based on age and modeling bear hunger. You'll modify existing methods and implement new ones to incorporate these additional behaviors.

## EX10: Linked List Algorithms

**Goal**: Implement algorithms to process a singly-linked list  
**Algorithms/Techniques In Focus**: Linked Lists, Recursion, Conditional Statements

**Description**:
In this exercise, you'll implement functions to process a singly-linked list data structure. You'll write recursive functions to perform operations such as retrieving the value at a given index, finding the maximum value, and scaling the values in a linked list by a given factor. This exercise will deepen your understanding of linked lists and recursion.
